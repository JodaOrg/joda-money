/**
 * Provides a uniform interface to obtain a {@code BigMoney}.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides an abstraction over {@link Money} and {@link BigMoney}.
 * In general, applications should use the concrete types, not this interface.
 * However, utilities and frameworks may choose to make use of this abstraction.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of {@code BigMoneyProvider} may be mutable.
 * To minimise the risk of the value of the provider changing while processing,
 * any method that takes a {@code BigMoneyProvider} as a parameter should convert
 * it to a {@code BigMoney} immediately and use that directly from then on.
 * The method {@link BigMoney#of(BigMoneyProvider)} performs the conversion
 * safely with null checks and is recommended for this purpose.
 * <p>
 * This interface makes no guarantees about the immutability or
 * thread-safety of implementations.
