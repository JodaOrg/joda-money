 * An amount of money with the standard decimal places defined by the currency.

 * This class represents a quantity of money, stored as a {@code BigDecimal} amount
 * in a single {@link CurrencyUnit currency}.

 * Every currency has a certain standard number of decimal places.
 * This is typically 2 (Euro, British Pound, US Dollar) but might be

 * The {@code Money} class is fixed to this number of decimal places.
 * <p>
 * For example, US dollars has a standard number of decimal places of 2.
 * The major units are dollars. The minor units are cents, 100 to the dollar.
 * This class does not allow calculations on fractions of a cent.
